The bacon was crispy, salty, and filled with flavor. The Italian sausage was bursting with flavor as well. The mozzarella was top notch, not too much, not too little. Crust: B. The crust was thin and tasty, but towards the middle of the large pie, the crust was soggy. Perhaps because of the size of the pizza and number of toppings. The top of the pizza was still well cooked, charred, and crisp, but the center definitely needed more time. I wouldn't say the pizza was as good as Sally's, but the service was certainly way better. We will definitely be back again in the future, and next time we will order either small or medium pizzas and hope the center of the crust is crispier.\",\n",

Each taco was a nice filet of tuna on a bed of slaw and simple creamy drizzle on top. Finish it off with a nice squeeze of a lemon wedge and you got seafood simplicity at its best! If seafood isn't your thing, they also have chicken tacos too. Aside of their bomb fish tacos, this place is your typical 'Florida seafood' restaurant that can be on the pricier side. Their other non-seafood dishes are fine, but I find that they shine with seafood. Also to note, try to catch their seasonal specials of rock shrimp (typically July-October) or lionfish (March-July) as well so try it out since it is a local special! The rock shrimp tastes like lobster, but in shrimp form.\"]]},\n",

With my dietary restrictions, it's hard finding restaurants that can answer my many questions and accommodate me, but Emeril's didn't disappoint! We had a party of 6 so split the calamari, shrimp and sausages - all enjoyed thoroughly (and forgot the pics because it was so good!). Fresh bread and cornbread accompanied the meal. We all chose either the lamb or the drum - and all enjoyed! Lamb was cooked perfectly, as was the fish. Desserts - we had the banana pie, bread pudding, cheese board, and tres leches cake. The desserts were good, but I wasn't as happy with the pie. I'm not sure if the recipe changed over the years, but I like more of a pudding/custard pie with smaller slices of banana. This was a huge piece of pie, but not quite what I expected.\",\n",

This time my wife ordered the \"most popular burger\" The Hells Kitchen Burger. I ordered off the signature side and grabbed The Hog Burger. Both burgers were well crafted with all the quality ingredients and techniques expected out of a Ramsey establishment. Wife\\'s burger was like a high end burger you could find most places, maybe slightly better. My burger was pork, pulled pork and bacon in a huge patty with cheese and onion straws I believe. It was a burger that once you pick up, you can\\'t put down because it was so good and also because it was falling apart. The onion rings were light and crispy and came with forgettable dipping sauces. I understand the place is called Burger, but I really wished to see them branch out more on the menu  and offer some different types of food.

The sauce bar has many items other Mongolian BBQ restaurants lack, such as sesame oil, garlic broth, cooking sherry, and hot chili oil. The cooks here are excellent, they will even take special requests like \"crispy noodles\" or \"add red pepper flakes\" having them cooked on the grill rather than added afterwards, or even fry your rice with the food. They will also clean and prep the grill for those with seafood or peanut allergies. Another thing HuHot offers that others don\\'t, is a selection of 3 noodle types, including ramen, & pad thai flat rice noodles. The asian salad included with dinner is a spring salad with crushed ramen noodles on top, a sweet asian vinaigrette, and a few mandarin wedges. Its a salad I\\'ve only seen one place come close to replicating. I would highly recommend this restaurant if you like mongolian BBQ.'],\n",

       "      \"What To Order: Puffy Tacos. . Over the years I had people mention Rays to me. Apparently a long time argument has been going on about who the original creator of the Puffy Taco is. So having grown up in San Antonio, and eaten puffy tacos at about a half dozen places, I decided to give this place a try. I was here for the food though, specifically puffy tacos. The menu contained a variety of your regular Mexican plates, and shortly after ordering, my plate of puffy tacos along with a little basket of chips and salsa arrived. The actual puffy taco here were a little different from other places I'd had them. Many places the taco is doughy, thicker with a flaky outside and moist corn center. Rays tacos were thinner shells, inflated up while frying with little to no center, however a bit chewier than other places. Other than the minor difference in the shell, the picadillo meat, and toppings of (cheese, lettuce, & chopped tomato) were much on par with the puffy tacos I've had many a place. Overall, the tacos were good, the service OK, and the prices fair, but the location is buried a bit on the west side. Its an out of the way location if your not in the neighborhood, but seeing how Ray's is a long local establishment, its worth a trip to check out the place the Puffy Taco started.\"],\n",

The burger was cooked to my specification (medium well) and there was a bounty of fries surrounding it. I was hankering for a burger, and opted for their Ultimate Bacon Cheeseburger. It's been a while since I've been to a Chili's and their burgers have definitely changed since my last visit. The patty is still thick however the girth of the burger and bun have definitely shrunk. The burger has a more gourmet appearance to it than used to as well along with the fries in a little metal tin. However you can dress it up any way you want, it's still just a generic burger.

I usually gauge how great the restaurant is based on its sashimi and the taste of the fish. Does it taste or smell fishy? Does it melt in your mouth or is it gamey/chewy. The sashimi here ended up being pretty good. It didn't taste fishy or smell fishy which goes a long way. The fish itself seemed pretty fresh but did not really melt in the mouth as one would hope. We ordered the spicy edamame as well and the sauce on those is heavenly. We ordered the Vegas, volcano, California (not my idea), and the Paris rolls. We ended the night with the strawberry and chocolate mochis and the new york style cheesecake. The mochi ice cream was average. This is definitely one of the better sushi places in the area!\"],\n",

My main issue with this particular location of Little Caesars, though is two fold. First, they've done a terrible job at cutting their pizza. I don't believe I have ever gotten a pizza from this location where the pizza was actually cut more than just through the cheese. Normally the pizza is still all completely together.

The calamari pieces were small so I would not really recommend as a great appetizer or a great calamari. . Telford entrees we just got 1 bowl of clam chowder, the crab cakes - dinner, and the halibut special. YUM. The crab cake-dinner was great! We started off with the small treasures of the reef starter and 2 apps - bang bang cauliflower and calamari. The treasures of the reef was a plate with 4 pieces of cocktail shrimp, 4 oysters & 4 raw clams, and 2 lobster tails. It was just the right amount of fresh raw seafood for us (party of 4). The bang bang cauliflower is so so good! It's a deep fried cauliflower tossed is some sort of sweet & spicy chili sauce. The calamari was okay. If you like clam chowder you need to try it. It came with a side of salad which paired nicely with the crab cakes. The crab cakes are not huge but decently sized. It's super soft and consists of chunks of crab.\",\n",

Then for appetizers, we got the Tuna Crudo which was SO good! It came with chunks of raw tuna and whipped avocado which we all loved so much. We also got the mini mushroom pizza which is perfect for the mushroom lovers. They had real chunks of blue crab in there and you could taste it in the pasta!

You cut up cucumbers, cilantro and carrots and wrap them up and bam. You've got a vietnamese vegetarian spring roll. No deep frying necessary (you don't typically fry these kind of rice rolls and only prepare/activate them by dipping them in water). I ordered Beef top round pho and instead got pork. I've had far better pho. The portion sizes are plentiful however pho noodles are supposed to be free floating in the broth.

In addition to the requisite nachos and wings, apps include a bevy of fried vegetables (zucchini chips, Korean BBQ cauliflower) while the entre selection works in a glazed grilled salmon and chicken and waffles. Its a compact menu but hardly an unappealing one, especially when the decadent shake selection is factored in. The fries  crispy and very well-seasoned  were a hit, and the salmon received favorable remarks as well. While the burgers were enjoyable, the toppings eclipsed the meat, and my wife reported a lack of char flavor. Both shakes were deliciously sweet and, as expected, not easy to consume neatly. The burgers are $12.49, fries included. By way of comparison, Porter House charges less ($9.95-$11.95) for more (more toppings, more side options, possibly bigger patties).

We ended up going with mozzarella sticks, linguine aglio y olio, fettuccini a modo mio, and tiramisu, and there wasnt a dud in the bunch. The mozzarella sticks had a nice bit of crunch and paired well with the housemade marinara. The aglio y olio, surprisingly hard to find elsewhere, packed a garlicky punch while the fettuccini offered well-cooked shrimp in a slightly sweet pink crab sauce, another rarity. While tiramisu is a whole lot more ubiquitous, Amalfis rendition held up well. The two entrees were $13 and $21, respectively, but both came with a choice of soup or salad as well as bread. Only the mozzarella sticks, at $9.49, felt like a reach.

We ended the meal with the pot du creme - highly recommend getting this. It was very smooth, almost like a mousse, and contested with a smattering of coarse sea salt on the top. There were fresh berries that popped in your mouth that accompanied it, and it came in three dollops.'],\n",

The rolls are so soft and chewy, and we fought over the last bits of date butter that came with it. Liberty duck: The best way to describe it would be if you combined the crispy skin of Peking duck with the meat of holiday ham, nestled next to wild rice pilaf with a sweet XO sauce.

Theres traditional Greek desserts like baklavas the size of my palm and other pastries like cakes and tarts. We ended up getting the strawberry shortcake and a walnut baklava. The barista there was also very funny and asked a lot of questions to make sure we got the flavor we wanted from our iced Greek coffees (I got sweet with milk, my friend got black). The strawberry shortcake was light and fluffy, and had real strawberry pieces inside. There was a fair amount of white frosting but it wasnt overly sweet. It was sweetened with a generous portion of honey and the crushed walnuts lent such a lovely texture against the phyllo dough. The bill was ~$23 for the two frappes and two desserts.

The vegan brownie is surprisingly good and has bits of peanut brittle that add a bit more interesting texture to an otherwise very soft brownie ($4). I also love the chocolate chip cookies - I think theyre some of the best and I love it whenever our office caters tender greens (TG as its affectionately known) and theres leftover chocolate chip cookies to munch on. Theyre the size of my palm and have big round chunks of chocolate embedded throughout. Depending on the batch, they can either be pretty crispy but I like them best when theyre slight chewy. Another favorite of mine is the buttermilk fried chicken - its not as heavy as you think and you could always get it in a salad. The salt and pepper chicken is also a solid bet if you want to get it in a salad or plate. You order at the cash register and move down the line sideways, then you have the option of getting drinks and dessert. The kombucha is $5 and its tall glass of pink fizziness.

Second time I got the catfish shrimp combo with fried cucumber, hush puppies, and a cup of gumbo. The cod was flavorless and Could easily tell it was cheap Walmart type cod. The catfish seemed like it came straight  from the lake. The shrimp was the only thing that was of good quality but the batter brought the taste down. Everything(the cod, catfish, shrimp, cucumber, and okra) was fried with the same homemade type fish batter. Don't get me wrong, The batter isn't bad but it gets tiring when everything tastes like it. The fries tasted straight like fish like if it's all fried in the same oil. The gumbo was OK. It was very light and more of a soup. It was missing a lot of Cajun spices. Did get a good amount of shrimp and veggies. Some of the okra was good and some was woody where I had to spit the skin out.\",\n",

I liked how the chicken was breaded and it was still crunchy even after the 20 minute car ride home.

The Bayou Burger is a handcrafted Andouille sausage and turkey burger and topped with blackened shrimp, finished with remounted, sriracha and house made Rajun Cajun slaw. I have to say that the Bayou Burger was quite a bit more spicy than I could enjoy. The spice masked the flavors of the burger so much that I cant really say what or how its tasted. The shrimps were cooked a bit too long as they were a bit rubbery. The Black and Blue burger is one of our standard orders when we visit and it was tasty as always. The fries were cooked right but quite a bit over salted tonight. I love that Burger21 features a new specialty burger each month and Im glad I tried the Bayou Burger.

The lasagna was quite flavorful and big enough that Im taking 1/3 of it home for lunch tomorrow. The Meatball Smash was a decent size and also quite tasty. For dessert, we tried a Cannoli (small and pretty good)and the Mascarpone Impastata which was really really delightful and worth stopping in just for that. Tonight was our second experience and we each ordered the Trio which came with three meatballs of your choice, one side and the Stoppe Salad. We ordered the chicken Marsala, Buffalo Chicken, Chicken Parmegian, Nonas traditional, sausage, and crab meatballs. Our favorites today were Nonnas Traditional, Chicken Parmigiana and the crab. The salad dressing on the Stoppe Salad was a nice Italian perfectly flavored. We also tried the Strawberry Chiffon cake for dessert which is a double layer cake with a vanilla pudding filling with slices strawberries and a light whipped cream topping.',\n",

So tonight we ordered that with a cup of chili for the side, and the Black and Blue burger with a side of fries. The Bayou Burger is a handcrafted Andouille sausage and turkey burger and topped with blackened shrimp, finished with remounted, sriracha and house made Rajun Cajun slaw. I have to say that the Bayou Burger was quite a bit more spicy than I could enjoy. The spice masked the flavors of the burger so much that I cant really say what or how its tasted. The shrimps were cooked a bit too long as they were a bit rubbery. The Black and Blue burger is one of our standard orders when we visit and it was tasty as always. The fries were cooked right but quite a bit over salted tonight. I love that Burger21 features a new specialty burger each month and Im glad I tried the Bayou Burger. I knew it would be spicy but was a little surprised at how spicy it is. There are many people that like a whole lot of spice and I know they will love this burger.']]},\n",

Jumbo scallops pan-seared in a sweet chili sauce, served alongside Squid Ink linguine with loads of crab meat, shitake mushrooms, fresh corn and asparagus in a lemon-butter sauce, topped with shaved Parmesan. The Yucatan Shrimp are enormous. I have never had shrimp that I would eat the legs from, except for these. It is rich and flavorful as a paella should be and the rice is perfectly cooked. The Island Shrimp and Grits are fantastic - the same fat gulf shrimp are dusted in masa flour and served over a jalapeno cheese grit surrounded by a tangy tomatillo sauce. The grits have all the jalepeno flavor without killing you with spice - and the dish is topped with julienned carrots and zucchini strips and a few crisp-cooked green beans which lighten what might otherwise be a heavy dish. The conch chowder is made with a great, thick, dark roux which makes it by far the best on the island. Last, but not least, the brownie desert - is HUGE. I am dying to try the Banana Leaf Snapper and may do so on Tuesday when we go again.']]},\n",

I am ever grateful to Craig who helped me discover my new favorite wine, a RED that was effervescent & slightly sweet, which was so perfect, because I rarely like reds! It was compared to a what a Red Moscato would be, but neither of us knew how to pronounce the name \"Quercioli...\" something...but it\\'s amazing! All the beverages I ever get here are delicious, my other favorites being the Watermelon Agua Fresca, the Red Sangria, and my go-to favorite (which I still don\\'t know what it\\'s called but I\\'ve been getting for years) is a sparkly raspberry & mint concoction, no alcohol, just deliciously refreshing! We\\'ve tried so many dishes over the years, one of my favorites is no longer in circulation, but I hope & pray they bring back the Goat Cheese, Fig & Basil appetizer, it is one of my ALL TIME favs, and I miss it dearly! My husband always goes for the Ahi Tuna salad, it\\'s divine! We are mostly pescatarian, but have tried some other items before, like the Chicken Pesto flatbread is pretty tasty, as is the artichoke flatbread. I have gotten the Cedar Plank Salmon with roasted Veggies the past few times, and I usually can only eat small portions before becoming full, but I always want a tidge more after finishing this yummy dish. I\\'ve tried the Sea Scallops (my mother\\'s FAVORITE dish), and Risotto, which I surprised myself because normally I am not such a big fan, but it was mighty tasty!']]},\n",

But in a bright side it is juicy and taste really good, it is just that I prefer the strips beef. MUSHROOM CHEESESTEAK: this is my favorite! the steak is juicy, the mushrooms are well cooked and the cheese melts inside the ground beef. PEPPER CHEESESTEAK: same juicy ground meat, the peppers are soft and tasty. I will come back here because it is good, I just prefer the strips philly cheesesteak but still good because the ground beef is juicy and delicious.',\n",

Made with real crab meat, not much of flour, all crab. My Oxtail was so soft and tasty, that I could not help lick my fingers everytime I picked up an Oxtail. The potato salad had the right amount of seasoning, my rice & peas cooked to perfection and my Mac & Cheese not to cheesy. But, again the downside is the meat's quantity. Unfortunately not much Oxtail for the $15.00 price. My wife said she wouldn't order the Crab cakes again, due to being so small and so few for the price; I would try the Catfish though.\"],\n",

The first was we wanted to try the famed Duck and then to try the famed Fried Chicken. Price wised for the food is alright if not a bit over priced but hey what do you expect from EV hipster Asian food for non-Asians and Asians who want to eat like their counterpart. Let's start with the 'Korean' fried chicken. Crispy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. It came with 'spicy' and non-spicy piled high on a platter. Don't expect the spicy to be anything more than a very light heat. It is served with a bowl of random vegetables and leafy lettuce to 'wrap.' Wrap what I'm not sure as it is fried chicken. The three dipping sauce was good. Frankly, I can go to 32nd and get Korean fried chicken that is cheaper, spicier and without the wait but then I can't say I've eaten Chang's Fried Chicken.

The pizza we ordered for the table was decent, it had good flavors, although the sauce could have had more flavor. We tried multiple pizzas, including their special, cheese and one with prosciutto on it, but it's far from a great Italian one. The desert pizza was advertised as having a lot of Nutella, but all we got was a baked dough with some strawberries on it and a little Nutella drizzle. The tiramisu, however, was shameful. It lacked any coffee flavor, the lady fingers are supposed to be soaked in coffee for that rich flavor, which ours did not have. The espresso, however, saved the day. It was made from Illy beans (at least I assume, since the stuff it came with had the logo on it). The terrible tiramisu then brought the score to 3.\",\n",

After wandering like tourists through the aisle of Eataly, already on sensory overload, we got in the long line to eat at La Pizza & La Pasta, on the second floor at Eataly in the back.

Our son is a plain pasta kind of guy (sighwe didnt raise him right) So thats what he got. I tried a noodle and the flavor was good but it was a little over cooked. We also had fresh mozzarella served with beets, pistachio pesto and squash (you get to pick any three items to accompany the burrata). La Pizza & La Pasta was definitely worth the wait.

They were a little similar, both being mushroom based and I ended up having a second hongos. Chips and guacamole was $8 with salsa or $3 with just salsa and no guacamole. The red sauce has a nice smokiness to it. They also do a nightly shot special with a premium liqueurin this case it was a Camarea Tequila shot. In general you cant go wrong with a three dollar tequila shot, but the fact that its a premium curated liqueur really brings it up a few notches.

For an Italian restaurant, which theoretically has lots of vegetarian options, this place wasn't particularly vegetarian friendly. For example they had many many salad options most of which automatically had chicken in them. I'm sure you could order it without the chicken but if you're going to have such an extensive salad menu, shouldn't you have vegetarians in mind in the choices that you offer as defaults? Our kid had the macaroni and cheese. The macaroni wasn't particularly good and the fries, where is they looked good, were coated in something. Rule of thumb for french fries  if you can't make decent regular french fries, and have to rely on coding them in something, you shouldn't be offering french fries at your restaurant. Also rule of thumb for macaroni and cheese for kidsit should always be the basic mac and cheese. If a kid doesnt like your mac and cheese, you have strayed in the wrong direction. Most of us were sharing a large cheese pizza. The first pizza came out under done, the crust was mushy. One of us got their gluten-free pizza. Kudos to you Biaggios for offering gluten-free crust, however you did get the order wrongit was ordered without cheese and, sure enough, came with cheese. Also the mushrooms topping tasted canned.

Masa of Echo Park is the only place (I know of) that you can get truly authentic and really good Chicago style deep-dish pizza. Sure, there are plenty of places that offer deep-dishbut to be truly authentic Chicago, its got to be more than thick doughyouve got to, as Masa does, use a buttery, somewhere between pizza dough and biscuit, crust. Youve got to put the cheese in first, then the toppings and sauce so the cheese seals the dough (and rises in bits through the sea of sauce to the top. Masa does all of this and provides the authentic Chicago pizza experience youre looking for. (Even if youre only looking for it sometimesmy mouth and belly have equal joy for authentic NY slices and occasionally I start thinking about real Chicago pizza and I just need it.) Masa is the real deal. Even my 9 year old who famously doesnt like anything besides plain pasta found his Plain-Jane pizza astonishingly good.

It was sweet, creamy, yet distinct squid flavor. Also, the shiso leaf's mint flavor complemented the squid rich taste quite well. Next we had, Kampachi, Amberjack from Hawaii. One of my favorite fishes for sashimi, the flesh is firm and rich. Topped with caramelized onions and blood orange kosho peel to cut through the high fat content of the fish. Shima Aji, Japanese Horse Mackerel was topped with ginger and supported by a bed of purple seaweed. Last but not least we had the Hiramasa, New Zealand Yellowtail Kingfish.\"],\n",

       "      \"I wanted to try out their $5.99 All You Can Eat Pizza, Pasta and Salad. They already had about 8 different pizzas out on the buffet. They were still working on setting up the pasta section but the salad bar was ready to go. They had a nice variety of pizza including Pepperoni, Buffalo Chicken, Spinach Alfredo, a regular Cheese Pizza, a Hawaiian with Ham and Pineapple, a BBQ Pork Pizza, a Pepperoni and Italian Sausage and a couple of others I am forgetting about. I liked the crust which tended towards thin however the crust underneath on several of the pizzas was flimsy and didn't hold up the slice. Also I found that some of the pizzas had cooled rather quickly while a couple were nice and hot. But all of the pizzas I sampled were tasty and I did enjoy them. My personal favorite was the buffalo chicken of which I had 3 slices. The salad bar was amply supplied with all the usual condiments to create a nice salad. Everything looked fresh and I enjoyed my salad very much. The pasta section appeared to only have some cork screw pasta available but there was your choice of an alfredo or marinara sauce. I got a small amount of pasta and chose the alfredo sauce which was unfortunately thin with only a minimum of alfredo flavor. Having said all that it is a $5.99 all you can eat buffet and they move large amounts of pizza quickly so given that I would still recommend it if you are in the area and  have a hankering for all you can eat pizza despite a few minor issues I mentioned.\"],\n",

I got the not spicy  sandwich and Im not sure  if this was a good idea. The chicken itself is pretty much the same quality and taste as the chicken breast used by Chick-fil-A. The pickle of Popeyes seems more flavorful and that gives the sandwich  a good zing. Im not a fan of Popeyes and I tend to give this 1 star, but based on this chicken sandwich and since I only review this product, Ill give it 4 stars. In terms of quality of products, chicken sandwich and having the option of adding stuff on. UPDTE:  I order today... my second time and I got the spicy  sandwich.

Rosas Salad is now hands down my favorite salad of all time, with all its ingredients coming together so delightfully like perfect puzzle pieces. I substituted the blue cheese with feta cheese, since thats my preference, and though there were still bits of blue cheese remaining, it was magical. My husband loves Rosas Specialty Dumplings, and understandably so. At first glance, the dumplings look like grandmas big@$$, homemade meatballs, but once we took a bite, the mysterious, savory experience was unlike anything weve ever tasted before.

Their taco was voted #1 Fish Taco in California by USA Today\\'s Readers\\' Poll Best of 2018. It is a sustainable, Wild Alaska Pollock, beer-battered by hand and cooked to a crisp, topped with white sauce, mild salsa, and cabbage, and served on a warm, stone-ground corn tortilla. While I could taste the flavors that led to Rubio\\'s winning best fish taco in California, I have to say it was muted. The taco just needed more white sauce and salsa to bring it to life. The Grilled Shrimp Burrito is a sustainable, grilled shrimp, with \"no-fried\" pinto beans (a company trademark), cheese, Mexican rice, salsa fresca, creamy chipotle sauce, and served on a warm flour tortilla with tortilla chips. Again, there was a lot of rice (which I address later) and not enough flavor--which should have been bursting through the tortilla with the way they built it. Luckily, the restaurant has a great salsa bar where you can load up your meal with additional deliciousness, which is what I did. I also ordered a large side of Mexican rice ($1.89) and that too lacked flavor (which seemed to be a recurring theme).'],\n",

I know what youre thinking: the quality cant be as good as a traditional sushi house, but Sushi Mido is as good as any place in Kansas City. Every time Ive gone, which was before, during, and after lunch and dinner rushes, I always see a steady stream of patrons and a small army of itamaes creating delicious sushi. They have a good menu of creative and flavorful offerings, but I always go for the all-you-can-eat sushi for $24.95 per person. That option comes with two of the following sides: two crab rangoons, edamame, ginger-dressed salad, hot-and-sour soup, egg drop soup, or miso soup. I love their ginger dressing and have been trying to replicate for home useit is a great balance of tangy and freshthey should sell bottles of it. When ordering, they give you a sheet listing all their rolls and grouped them into veggie, cooked, fried, and raw. To avoid wasting food, Sushi Mido recommends ordering in rounds of two-to-three rolls per person. There is a $0.75 per piece leftover charge for any unfinished sushi, which cannot be taken home. I will give a hint through: when you are eating, start with the fried rolls first, because (in my opinion) they are the most difficult to eat near the end of the meal, when you are nearing capacity. The fish is of high-quality and tastes delicious and the vegetables are crisp and fresh.'],\n",

The name of the dish is actually misnomer, the shrimp was not stuffed with crab, but rather attached to side of the ball of stuffing. The flavors were unbalanced and too rich, whereby I craved additional shrimp and less cream sauceor at least a bed of pasta underneath. My wife ordered their Great Grouper Sandwich ($14), blackened (you can also get it grilled or fried) and a choice of either fries or coleslaw. She too was underwhelmed, nay disappointed, while the fish itself had a good flavor it was way too salty and diminished the blackened flavors. Our kids ordered a cheeseburger with fries ($7) and the burgers were actually goodgood quality beef and cooked well.'],\n",

Reef Donkey Pale Ale. I ordered their Craft Burger ($9) for a humanely-raised, antibiotic- and hormone-free prime beef, local tomatoes, lettuce, onion, served on a brioche bun, with a side of rough-cut potato salad. You can also get a lot of interesting and delicious burger toppings, for an extra charge, but I recommend going hog-wild. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and was seasoned perfectlyI loved it, so many restaurants overcook burgers, but Craft Street nailed it. I opted for their shoestring fries and was glad I didthey were delicious and extra crispy. However, I wouldnt classify them as shoestring, because I think of spaghetti-looking fries, Like the ones at Steak n Shake. My wife ordered the Figster Salad ($14) made up of pecan-crusted chicken, port-marinated figs, Bartlett pears, candied pecans, gorgonzola, mixed greens, spinach, and dressed with a port fig vinaigrette. Our kids ordered cheeseburgers ($6) and fries (you can sub fries out for fresh fruit) and they loved them. Their burgers were made from the same premium ingredients as mine and parents appreciate that.'],\n",

You can create a meal with a variety of tapas, or choose a selection as an appetizer and enjoy one of their paellas as your main course. We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Catalan Tomato Bread ($11); the bread was toasted crisp and paired with the cheese and sauce well. The Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli ($7.50) is a definite crowd pleaser with its tangy aioli and crispy-on-the-outside potato cubes and fluffy innards. The six of us had to arm wrestle for the three Bacalao Croquettes with Sherry Aioli ($2.50), but halved them and ordered more; this plate had a lot of flavor and good spice. Ba Ba Reebas infamous Paella de Mariscos with Shrimp, Squid, Preserved Mussels & Fennel ($17) was spectaculartrue paella, cooked perfectly; you have to order it first, because it takes a while to make and then magically appears. Their Rioja-Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Seasonal Vegetables & Rioja Wine Glaze ($14) was a show stopper; so tender and delicious, we tore into it before I could snap a picture. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes ($9.50) was a solid plate with fresh, firm shrimp. My favorite plate was the Seared Scallops with Red Kuri Squash Pure, Maple Vinaigrette and Candied Pumpkin Seeds ($14); I would have ordered ten of these plates and been a happy man. We ordered the Caramelized Banana ($3.50), with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios; a great option to end a meal with a sweet, yet not-too-rich dessert. The Chocolate Truffle Cake ($3.50), with kahlua, whipped cream was rich and decadentmake sure your belly is ready for this delicous cake. Saving the best for last again was the Marcona Almond-Caramel Bar ($3.50) with whpped cream and a butter crustYUM. You can order lots of small plates for every palette and picky eater.'],\n",

My wide ordered the Snapper ($20), blackened with a side of pasta and a vegetable medley. They know how to cook fish. The restaurant does not have a kids menu, which is odd in my humble opinion, so we ordered the Cheeseburger ($13), served with fries.

The Food:  The Crawfish Etoufee Dog was much to subtle a flavor for this powerful taste of a spicy Creole mustard. The Dat Burger is a hamburger shaped like a hot dog, on a hot dog bun. It has all the typical additions of a hamburger, onion, pickle, mustard, ketchup....etc. Something about tasting a hamburger shaped like that put me off.

       "      'THE FOOD:. We ordered \"Meatball on Garlic Toast\" as an appetizer. The Meatballs on Garlic toast is an old favorite. The meatball is tasty, flavorful and the red sauce accents the flavor even more. The garlic toast is good for sopping up the last bit. I got the Roasted beet salad, and it\\'s just super. Light vinaigrette, good greens..yummy. For my entree, I got the Double Stuffed Pork Chop, which is a double-cut pork chop breaded and stuffed with a seafood stuffing, topped with a light pineapple demi-glace. Babycakes had her usual, the Stuffed Chicken Breast, which is chicken breast stuffed with provolone cheese, prosciutto and artichoke hearts-breaded, baked and topped with a mushroom Marsala sauce. The veal meatball was tender, seasoned perfectly, simply scrumptious,  and even though it\\'s HUGE.. left me wanting another! Its in a red sauce with garlic and oregano TOAST. I got Corn and Crab Bisque in a bread bowl as a soup upgrade ($6.00 more), and it was also... superb. Creamy, and savory with crab and corn flavors, and bits of crab and whole corn in it. We got House Salads, mine with house vinaigrette,  the girl who would be my girlfriend got a Bleu Cheese vinaigrette in hers. The greens were fresh and delicious and the house vinaigrette had a bright flavor, not too oily or vinegary. As far as the House Salad with Bleu Cheese vinaigrette,  I was told it was the best salad of her life. I ordered the Italian Sausage served on Angel hair with red sauce. The Italian Sausage was sweet and flavorful with anise and oregano and hit my nose as well as the tongue. The red sauce had great tomato flavor, and was herb-y and good. I was disappointed with the Angel hair pasta. The Stuffed Chicken Breast. Stuffed with provolone, prosciutto,  and artichoke hearts, then breaded, baked topped with mushroom marsala. The chicken done perfectly with all that stuffed, tasty goodness in it.....but then you have delicious, thick mushrooms in a marsala sauce that tastes of wine, smokey goodness, and savoryness that I haven\\'t tasted that good since...... ever!'],\n",

       "      \"Edit: came back after more than a year and several other ramen restaurants tried; and had the miso ramen $12.50. Didnt like it, doesnt have as much multidimensional flavor as the tonkatsu, (now $13.50) it just felt salty to me. The noodles were good, cooked firm, the egg was also fine, the meat looked a bit different to what I'm used to in other ramen. My companion got the tantan and that one was so much better: spicy, salty, and a bit sweet from the ground pork. The quality of the ramen is good, I probably shouldn't have gotten miso, but I didnt want to spend much more money on a more special ramen and thoguht the miso would be good enough already. Original: Good tonkotsu ramen~ we got 3 bowls, mine without garlic, and they were delicious. Plenty of noodles,2 thin pieces of pork, some seaweed and a soft boiled egg. The bowl is $12, there are a couple more economic bowls (shoyu,miso) for $10.50 and some special bowls that go up to $16. The restaurant serves a variety of dishes other than ramen,like rice bowls, fried rice, appetizers (gyoza), etc.\"],\n",

A server came to give us ordering sheets a bit before 530 and explained the different kinds of ramen, recommended not to go for too spicy the first time (just spiciness 1 or 2). The ramen were tasty, with good proportions, although one con is that you need to order the egg on the side for $1.75 (pricey!). I hadnt eaten anything else for dinner, so it could only have been the ramen. Not sure if anything in it was bad, the only difference between our ramens was that I got the chasu, and that my ramen seemed to have a small hair (I just took it out, dont usually freak out about hairs). While it could have just been that my stomach got upset from eating a flavorful and salty broth (and I got it light salt, mild), I'd probably not come back often because of the stomach issue and the long waits.\"],\n",

At $24 a lobster roll, we thought it wasnt a bad price (considering where we were) as long as there was ample lobster meat. The menu said each lobster roll has 1/4 lb meat but when we got the rolls it felt like it must have been more. But even better than the lobster roll was the Surf and Turf Philly ($16) which paired tender shaved beef with lobster and cheese to make one of the most delicious sandwiches weve ever had. We are definitely going back and ordering that Philly again. I should also mention that with one of our lobster rolls we substituted the waffle fries with lobster mac and it was excellent. It was creamy (in both texture and flavor) and paired well with the lobster which is mostly served on top with some lobster flavor blending into the cheese sauce.',\n",

The steak tartare was really well seasoned and served with toasted slices of baguette and a small salad. The tarte flamb - which was basically a flatbread, was topped with fresh veggies and cheese. The sausage was definitely homemade and super flavorful. We then went onto the entrees, our choices were the risotto with morels and asparagus (which is seasonal), the steak frites - that btw comes with bone marrow, and the chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. The steak was very nicely cooked and flavorful, the fries werent the best ever but were pretty good nevertheless.

You can choose among many options, different beef or pork combos are a great option if youre  in a  group, or you can just pick your favorite cuts. They also have a few options if you want something other than bbq: Japchae, bibimbap, tteokbokki, pajeon, mul naengmyeon, just to name a few. What I recommend you guys to try for sure is the pork belly (samgyeopsal), perfectly layered and absolutely delicious with just a tad of salt or doenjang and made into a wrap with lettuce and kimchi (and raw garlic if you like it). Other dishes Id recommend are the marinated galbi, the bulgogi, and the ribeye. As far as other dishes Im a huge fan of their Japchae, their tteokbokki, and the cold green tea noodles. If you want something small(er) as an appetizer try the kimchi jeon, or the pajeon, theyre pretty good and always made fresh. The banchan dishes are delicious, always order raw garlic on the side if you want the authentic experience, and the pickle onion they bring is to die for. Their kimchi is also very good, and so are the sauces they give you for the meats - The teriyaki sauce with bean flour is sweet and sticky, while the doenjang is nice and salty.'],\n",

The other has more premium cuts like skirt steak, short rib, gopchang, squid, shrimp, octopus... and comes at 38.99$. Either options are great, and I'd say that unless you want seafood the OG is perfect. We did want seafood (and gopchang) so we ended up going for the premium option. We also added a couple sides (most are included, just a few aren't): spicy rice cakes - aka tteokbokki, japchae, and sundubujjigae. The Berkshire pork belly is nice and thick and fatty, and goes perfect with lettuce, kimchi and onion (and garlic if you're not scared of it). The marinated bulgogi was very flavorful and not too sweet - which sometimes can be. The shrimp was nice as well, and every cut of meat was carefully prepared by our waiter who was super nice and made sure no cut was over cooked.

       "    'review_text': 'We started with steak tartare, a tarte, and one of their homemade sausages with sauerkraut. The steak tartare was really well seasoned and served with toasted slices of baguette and a small salad. The tarte flamb - which was basically a flatbread, was topped with fresh veggies and cheese. The sausage was definitely homemade and super flavorful. We then went onto the entrees, our choices were the risotto with morels and asparagus (which is seasonal), the steak frites - that btw comes with bone marrow, and the chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. The steak was very nicely cooked and flavorful, the fries werent the best ever but were pretty good nevertheless. The piece de resistance was without a doubt the profiteroles - perfect choux pastry filled with ice cream as well as homemade whipped cream, and topped with a delicious dark chocolate sauce.',\n",

You can choose among many options, different beef or pork combos are a great option if youre  in a  group, or you can just pick your favorite cuts. They also have a few options if you want something other than bbq: Japchae, bibimbap, tteokbokki, pajeon, mul naengmyeon, just to name a few. What I recommend you guys to try for sure is the pork belly (samgyeopsal), perfectly layered and absolutely delicious with just a tad of salt or doenjang and made into a wrap with lettuce and kimchi (and raw garlic if you like it). Other dishes Id recommend are the marinated galbi, the bulgogi, and the ribeye. As far as other dishes Im a huge fan of their Japchae, their tteokbokki, and the cold green tea noodles. If you want something small(er) as an appetizer try the kimchi jeon, or the pajeon, theyre pretty good and always made fresh. The banchan dishes are delicious, always order raw garlic on the side if you want the authentic experience, and the pickle onion they bring is to die for. Their kimchi is also very good, and so are the sauces they give you for the meats - The teriyaki sauce with bean flour is sweet and sticky, while the doenjang is nice and salty.'],\n",

The other has more premium cuts like skirt steak, short rib, gopchang, squid, shrimp, octopus... and comes at 38.99$. Either options are great, and I'd say that unless you want seafood the OG is perfect. We did want seafood (and gopchang) so we ended up going for the premium option. We also added a couple sides (most are included, just a few aren't): spicy rice cakes - aka tteokbokki, japchae, and sundubujjigae. The Berkshire pork belly is nice and thick and fatty, and goes perfect with lettuce, kimchi and onion (and garlic if you're not scared of it). The marinated bulgogi was very flavorful and not too sweet - which sometimes can be. The shrimp was nice as well, and every cut of meat was carefully prepared by our waiter who was super nice and made sure no cut was over cooked. We accompanied our meal with makgeolli and soju (they have a combo deal for 15$), that were much needed with such a meaty feast.\"],\n",

They also have a plethora of other offal items, but also cater to those who are more into pork belly and beef.

       "    'review_text': 'I ordered their Cabo Plate ($11.49), which came with their Original Fish Taco, Classic Grilled Shrimp Burrito, pinto beans, and chips. Their taco was voted #1 Fish Taco in California by USA Today\\'s Readers\\' Poll Best of 2018. It is a sustainable, Wild Alaska Pollock, beer-battered by hand and cooked to a crisp, topped with white sauce, mild salsa, and cabbage, and served on a warm, stone-ground corn tortilla. While I could taste the flavors that led to Rubio\\'s winning best fish taco in California, I have to say it was muted. The taco just needed more white sauce and salsa to bring it to life. The Grilled Shrimp Burrito is a sustainable, grilled shrimp, with \"no-fried\" pinto beans (a company trademark), cheese, Mexican rice, salsa fresca, creamy chipotle sauce, and served on a warm flour tortilla with tortilla chips. Again, there was a lot of rice (which I address later) and not enough flavor--which should have been bursting through the tortilla with the way they built it. Luckily, the restaurant has a great salsa bar where you can load up your meal with additional deliciousness, which is what I did. I also ordered a large side of Mexican rice ($1.89) and that too lacked flavor (which seemed to be a recurring theme).',\n",

Other choices are hummus, fries, tabouli, falafel, salad, rice, babaghanouge, spiced carrots and walnuts, or pomegranate eggplant and walnuts. Also, if you want to go nuts, you can Style Your Dish with additional accoutrements for $3 more; I went with the Greek and added roasted bell peppers, grilled onions and mushrooms, and feta cheese.

       "      'This All-You-Can Eat Sushi Idea Works for Your Belly and Wallet. I know what youre thinking: the quality cant be as good as a traditional sushi house, but Sushi Mido is as good as any place in Kansas City. Every time Ive gone, which was before, during, and after lunch and dinner rushes, I always see a steady stream of patrons and a small army of itamaes creating delicious sushi. They have a good menu of creative and flavorful offerings, but I always go for the all-you-can-eat sushi for $24.95 per person. That option comes with two of the following sides: two crab rangoons, edamame, ginger-dressed salad, hot-and-sour soup, egg drop soup, or miso soup. I love their ginger dressing and have been trying to replicate for home useit is a great balance of tangy and freshthey should sell bottles of it. When ordering, they give you a sheet listing all their rolls and grouped them into veggie, cooked, fried, and raw. To avoid wasting food, Sushi Mido recommends ordering in rounds of two-to-three rolls per person. There is a $0.75 per piece leftover charge for any unfinished sushi, which cannot be taken home. I will give a hint through: when you are eating, start with the fried rolls first, because (in my opinion) they are the most difficult to eat near the end of the meal, when you are nearing capacity. The fish is of high-quality and tastes delicious and the vegetables are crisp and fresh.'],\n",

I ordered their Crab Stuffed Red Shrimp ($19), which was shrimp and lump crab stuffing, over-baked, and served over a cream sauce; you had a choice of two sides--I got the mac-and-cheese and their sweet hush puppies. The sides were fine nothing great but nothing bad, but the shrimp and crab were completely underwhelming. The name of the dish is actually misnomer, the shrimp was not stuffed with crab, but rather attached to side of the ball of stuffing. The flavors were unbalanced and too rich, whereby I craved additional shrimp and less cream sauceor at least a bed of pasta underneath. My wife ordered their Great Grouper Sandwich ($14), blackened (you can also get it grilled or fried) and a choice of either fries or coleslaw. She too was underwhelmed, nay disappointed, while the fish itself had a good flavor it was way too salty and diminished the blackened flavors. Our kids ordered a cheeseburger with fries ($7) and the burgers were actually goodgood quality beef and cooked well.'],\n",

You can also get a lot of interesting and delicious burger toppings, for an extra charge, but I recommend going hog-wild. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and was seasoned perfectlyI loved it, so many restaurants overcook burgers, but Craft Street nailed it. I opted for their shoestring fries and was glad I didthey were delicious and extra crispy. However, I wouldnt classify them as shoestring, because I think of spaghetti-looking fries, Like the ones at Steak n Shake. My wife ordered the Figster Salad ($14) made up of pecan-crusted chicken, port-marinated figs, Bartlett pears, candied pecans, gorgonzola, mixed greens, spinach, and dressed with a port fig vinaigrette.

Light vinaigrette, good greens..yummy. For my entree, I got the Double Stuffed Pork Chop, which is a double-cut pork chop breaded and stuffed with a seafood stuffing, topped with a light pineapple demi-glace. Babycakes had her usual, the Stuffed Chicken Breast, which is chicken breast stuffed with provolone cheese, prosciutto and artichoke hearts-breaded, baked and topped with a mushroom Marsala sauce.

The greens were fresh and delicious and the house vinaigrette had a bright flavor, not too oily or vinegary. As far as the House Salad with Bleu Cheese vinaigrette,  I was told it was the best salad of her life. I ordered the Italian Sausage served on Angel hair with red sauce. The Italian Sausage was sweet and flavorful with anise and oregano and hit my nose as well as the tongue. The red sauce had great tomato flavor, and was herb-y and good. I was disappointed with the Angel hair pasta. The Stuffed Chicken Breast. Stuffed with provolone, prosciutto,  and artichoke hearts, then breaded, baked topped with mushroom marsala. The chicken done perfectly with all that stuffed, tasty goodness in it.....but then you have delicious, thick mushrooms in a marsala sauce that tastes of wine, smokey goodness, and savoryness that I haven\\'t tasted that good since...... ever!'],\n",

       "    'review_text': 'Not only is the location really pretty and very typical - you almost feel like being on the second floor of a korean market, where they cook what you bought - but the food is simply AMAZING. You can choose among many options, different beef or pork combos are a great option if youre  in a  group, or you can just pick your favorite cuts. They also have a few options if you want something other than bbq: Japchae, bibimbap, tteokbokki, pajeon, mul naengmyeon, just to name a few. What I recommend you guys to try for sure is the pork belly (samgyeopsal), perfectly layered and absolutely delicious with just a tad of salt or doenjang and made into a wrap with lettuce and kimchi (and raw garlic if you like it). Other dishes Id recommend are the marinated galbi, the bulgogi, and the ribeye. As far as other dishes Im a huge fan of their Japchae, their tteokbokki, and the cold green tea noodles. If you want something small(er) as an appetizer try the kimchi jeon, or the pajeon, theyre pretty good and always made fresh. The banchan dishes are delicious, always order raw garlic on the side if you want the authentic experience, and the pickle onion they bring is to die for. Their kimchi is also very good, and so are the sauces they give you for the meats - The teriyaki sauce with bean flour is sweet and sticky, while the doenjang is nice and salty.',\n",

The steak tartare was really well seasoned and served with toasted slices of baguette and a small salad. The tarte flamb - which was basically a flatbread, was topped with fresh veggies and cheese. The sausage was definitely homemade and super flavorful. We then went onto the entrees, our choices were the risotto with morels and asparagus (which is seasonal), the steak frites - that btw comes with bone marrow, and the chicken with mashed potatoes and veggies. The steak was very nicely cooked and flavorful, the fries werent the best ever but were pretty good nevertheless.

The other has more premium cuts like skirt steak, short rib, gopchang, squid, shrimp, octopus... and comes at 38.99$. Either options are great, and I'd say that unless you want seafood the OG is perfect. We did want seafood (and gopchang) so we ended up going for the premium option. We also added a couple sides (most are included, just a few aren't): spicy rice cakes - aka tteokbokki, japchae, and sundubujjigae. The Berkshire pork belly is nice and thick and fatty, and goes perfect with lettuce, kimchi and onion (and garlic if you're not scared of it). The marinated bulgogi was very flavorful and not too sweet - which sometimes can be. The shrimp was nice as well, and every cut of meat was carefully prepared by our waiter who was super nice and made sure no cut was over cooked. We accompanied our meal with makgeolli and soju (they have a combo deal for 15$), that were much needed with such a meaty feast.\"],\n",

They also have a plethora of other offal items, but also cater to those who are more into pork belly and beef.

The pickle of Popeyes seems more flavorful and that gives the sandwich  a good zing. Im not a fan of Popeyes and I tend to give this 1 star, but based on this chicken sandwich and since I only review this product, Ill give it 4 stars. In terms of quality of products, chicken sandwich and having the option of adding stuff on. UPDTE:  I order today... my second time and I got the spicy  sandwich.

The noodles were good, cooked firm, the egg was also fine, the meat looked a bit different to what I'm used to in other ramen. My companion got the tantan and that one was so much better: spicy, salty, and a bit sweet from the ground pork. The quality of the ramen is good, I probably shouldn't have gotten miso, but I didnt want to spend much more money on a more special ramen and thoguht the miso would be good enough already. Original: Good tonkotsu ramen~ we got 3 bowls, mine without garlic, and they were delicious. Plenty of noodles,2 thin pieces of pork, some seaweed and a soft boiled egg. The bowl is $12, there are a couple more economic bowls (shoyu,miso) for $10.50 and some special bowls that go up to $16.

I hadnt eaten anything else for dinner, so it could only have been the ramen. Not sure if anything in it was bad, the only difference between our ramens was that I got the chasu, and that my ramen seemed to have a small hair (I just took it out, dont usually freak out about hairs).

I know what youre thinking: the quality cant be as good as a traditional sushi house, but Sushi Mido is as good as any place in Kansas City. Every time Ive gone, which was before, during, and after lunch and dinner rushes, I always see a steady stream of patrons and a small army of itamaes creating delicious sushi. They have a good menu of creative and flavorful offerings, but I always go for the all-you-can-eat sushi for $24.95 per person. That option comes with two of the following sides: two crab rangoons, edamame, ginger-dressed salad, hot-and-sour soup, egg drop soup, or miso soup. I love their ginger dressing and have been trying to replicate for home useit is a great balance of tangy and freshthey should sell bottles of it. When ordering, they give you a sheet listing all their rolls and grouped them into veggie, cooked, fried, and raw. To avoid wasting food, Sushi Mido recommends ordering in rounds of two-to-three rolls per person. There is a $0.75 per piece leftover charge for any unfinished sushi, which cannot be taken home. I will give a hint through: when you are eating, start with the fried rolls first, because (in my opinion) they are the most difficult to eat near the end of the meal, when you are nearing capacity. The fish is of high-quality and tastes delicious and the vegetables are crisp and fresh.',\n",

Their taco was voted #1 Fish Taco in California by USA Today\\'s Readers\\' Poll Best of 2018. It is a sustainable, Wild Alaska Pollock, beer-battered by hand and cooked to a crisp, topped with white sauce, mild salsa, and cabbage, and served on a warm, stone-ground corn tortilla. While I could taste the flavors that led to Rubio\\'s winning best fish taco in California, I have to say it was muted. The taco just needed more white sauce and salsa to bring it to life. The Grilled Shrimp Burrito is a sustainable, grilled shrimp, with \"no-fried\" pinto beans (a company trademark), cheese, Mexican rice, salsa fresca, creamy chipotle sauce, and served on a warm flour tortilla with tortilla chips. Again, there was a lot of rice (which I address later) and not enough flavor--which should have been bursting through the tortilla with the way they built it. Luckily, the restaurant has a great salsa bar where you can load up your meal with additional deliciousness, which is what I did. I also ordered a large side of Mexican rice ($1.89) and that too lacked flavor (which seemed to be a recurring theme).'],\n",

       "      'The spread had little to no flavor, it couldve used seasoning from something as simple as salt and pepper to something as complex as Old Bay seasoning. I ordered their Crab Stuffed Red Shrimp ($19), which was shrimp and lump crab stuffing, over-baked, and served over a cream sauce; you had a choice of two sides--I got the mac-and-cheese and their sweet hush puppies. The sides were fine nothing great but nothing bad, but the shrimp and crab were completely underwhelming. The name of the dish is actually misnomer, the shrimp was not stuffed with crab, but rather attached to side of the ball of stuffing. The flavors were unbalanced and too rich, whereby I craved additional shrimp and less cream sauceor at least a bed of pasta underneath. My wife ordered their Great Grouper Sandwich ($14), blackened (you can also get it grilled or fried) and a choice of either fries or coleslaw. She too was underwhelmed, nay disappointed, while the fish itself had a good flavor it was way too salty and diminished the blackened flavors. Our kids ordered a cheeseburger with fries ($7) and the burgers were actually goodgood quality beef and cooked well.'],\n",

Reef Donkey Pale Ale. I ordered their Craft Burger ($9) for a humanely-raised, antibiotic- and hormone-free prime beef, local tomatoes, lettuce, onion, served on a brioche bun, with a side of rough-cut potato salad. You can also get a lot of interesting and delicious burger toppings, for an extra charge, but I recommend going hog-wild. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium and was seasoned perfectlyI loved it, so many restaurants overcook burgers, but Craft Street nailed it. I opted for their shoestring fries and was glad I didthey were delicious and extra crispy. However, I wouldnt classify them as shoestring, because I think of spaghetti-looking fries, Like the ones at Steak n Shake. My wife ordered the Figster Salad ($14) made up of pecan-crusted chicken, port-marinated figs, Bartlett pears, candied pecans, gorgonzola, mixed greens, spinach, and dressed with a port fig vinaigrette. Our kids ordered cheeseburgers ($6) and fries (you can sub fries out for fresh fruit) and they loved them. Their burgers were made from the same premium ingredients as mine and parents appreciate that.'],\n",

You can create a meal with a variety of tapas, or choose a selection as an appetizer and enjoy one of their paellas as your main course. We ordered the Burrata Cheese with Catalan Tomato Bread ($11); the bread was toasted crisp and paired with the cheese and sauce well. The Spicy Potatoes with Tomato Aioli ($7.50) is a definite crowd pleaser with its tangy aioli and crispy-on-the-outside potato cubes and fluffy innards. The six of us had to arm wrestle for the three Bacalao Croquettes with Sherry Aioli ($2.50), but halved them and ordered more; this plate had a lot of flavor and good spice. Ba Ba Reebas infamous Paella de Mariscos with Shrimp, Squid, Preserved Mussels & Fennel ($17) was spectaculartrue paella, cooked perfectly; you have to order it first, because it takes a while to make and then magically appears. Their Rioja-Braised Short Rib with Manchego Mashed Potatoes, Roasted Seasonal Vegetables & Rioja Wine Glaze ($14) was a show stopper; so tender and delicious, we tore into it before I could snap a picture. The Shrimp with Garlic, Olive Oil, Red Pepper Flakes ($9.50) was a solid plate with fresh, firm shrimp. My favorite plate was the Seared Scallops with Red Kuri Squash Pure, Maple Vinaigrette and Candied Pumpkin Seeds ($14); I would have ordered ten of these plates and been a happy man. We ordered the Caramelized Banana ($3.50), with vanilla ice cream, quince syrup, and toasted pistachios; a great option to end a meal with a sweet, yet not-too-rich dessert. The Chocolate Truffle Cake ($3.50), with kahlua, whipped cream was rich and decadentmake sure your belly is ready for this delicous cake. Saving the best for last again was the Marcona Almond-Caramel Bar ($3.50) with whpped cream and a butter crustYUM. You can order lots of small plates for every palette and picky eater.'],\n",

Most tacos usually come stuffed enough for you to split into two (be sure to ask for extra tortillas). They have free chips and salsa available, and the salsa bar has a wide selection. My personal favorite has always been the green salsa. The fajita is very tender, and the cheddar they use adds nice flavors to their tacos (if it contains cheese). The pricing is just a tad more expensive than most taco joints in Laredo but considerably less expensive than a more central city like Austin, and they're worth it.\"],\n",

Their taco menu is pretty simple, it's basically veggie, beef, chicken, or a combination of meat and veggies hybrid all topped with some sliced avocado and cheese. I really enjoy their hybrid tacos, and their charro beans are great. Their tortas are also pretty good and filling. It's not truly traditional Mexican tacos, but it's pretty close. I would say it's a slightly modern Mexican style taco because the fajita flavor and texture parallels what I've had in street tacos. They also have a lower carb cheese tortilla that seems interesting, but I have not personally tried it. I will say, the tacos are pretty pricey, but 2 will fill you up well.

The fresh rolls taste GREAT and FRESH. The shrimp was not as fresh as the vegetables, but that is bearable. The steamed bun was very TASTY, considering that is not friend and you're eating just this semi-sweet dough with some veggies inside. One of my friends ordered the coconut JUICE, which is coconut water but comes with PIECES of COCONUT. For the main course I tried the Canh Chua ($11), a sweet and sour tamarind soup, that includes fried tofu and either jasmine rice or rice noodles on the side.

The most important ingredient of a ramen bowl is the broth, and in Ramen-san, the taste of the traditional soup was thick and umami-rich. So that, the Tonkotsu ramen as a whole was solid as I had expected. However, the Shiitake ramen broth was too salty and too fatty to us.
